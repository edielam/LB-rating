Maybe he/she worked so hard to get that job, he did not think he would not be satisfied, or he could not get information from the employees who work there. At this point, we wanted to help the people who want to enter their dream job. Then we prepared some questions about the working conditions of that company. We want to get ideas from people who have already worked or still working, by helping people who want to get there by giving them a star rating about the companies they work for."

Then We decided to use the React library and navigate between pages with React-Roter to give our project an advantage in terms of functionality. Now you can see this is the result of the two-week goal. We aim to develop our project much more further and move it forward. As the VOTING team, Thank you, for your interest."

Then we performed the routing process with express. With Mongoose, we created the scheme of the data to be saved in our database. According to these schemes, we wrote the functions that will perform the saving process, then we created functions for the data we will fetch from our database and connected to the API."
